    <h2 id="line2_1">Tutoring Vs. Teaching</h2>
    <p> Tutoring is very different from teaching or lecturing. Teachers have a syllabus to adhere to. They must cover 100% of the course content regardless of overall student understanding or progress.<br><br>
        On the other hand, tutors do not have the time restraints of a syllabus or a structured curriculum. They can work with their students at a much slower pace if needed. A tutor is more of a guide or facilitator, helping students to complete their work and understand the material, even if it takes multiple sessions.</p>

    <h2 id="line2_2">The CTAS Approach to Tutoring</h2>
    <p> As the charts above suggest, CTAS promotes a student-centered model of tutoring, where we put the <b>student</b>
        at the center of every session. Using this model, the most successful sessions are very engaging and
        conversational, with back and forth dialog between the student and the tutor. With the help of their tutor,
        students should set the agenda at the start of a session and remain in charge of that session throughout. Tutors
        merely facilitate the learning by asking solid open-ended questions and rephrasing questions when the student
        struggles to answer the first time. In addition, CTAS tutors should never assume the role of “Instructor,” nor
        should they simply provide all the answers or “fix” writing or homework errors.<br><br>
        Good tutors will also “think out loud” when modeling how to complete a specific task. CTAS tutors should also
        take advantage of teachable moments, especially when it comes to demonstrating successful study skills that may
        be useful to tackle a particular assignment.<br><br>
        And finally, CTAS tutors should be friendly and provide a comfortable learning environment for students. The

    <h2 id="line3_2" >The Tutor Hiring Process</h2>
    <h2 style="font-weight: normal;">Submission of Applications</h2>
    <p>Applicants should visit the “Employment” section of the CTAS website where they can fill out an online
        application, submit a resume, and upload their latest college transcript as per the instructions. The applicant
        will be contacted shortly thereafter as to the status of the application.<br><br>
        Completed Tutor Applications are forwarded to the Associate Director (AD), who will open a file for the
        applicant and review the application. The applicant will be informed of the status of the application and, if
        appropriate, told which pieces of documentation are needed to complete his/her file (transcript/resume, hours of
        availability, etc.).<br><br>
        Consideration for an interview will be determined both by the applicant’s documentation on file and by student
        need for tutoring in the subject area(s) offered. Interviews will be scheduled by the (AD).
    </p>

    <h2>Interviews</h2>
    <p>All interviews will be conducted by at least two full-time professional staff members. At the interview, a brief
        overview of the program will be given and issues of pay-rates, scheduling procedures and tutor log
        responsibilities will be explained. For Writing Tutor applicants, a short grammar proficiency test will be
        given, and a writing sample will also be taken at the interview.<br><br>
        Applicants will be evaluated on specific qualifications in the following categories: applicability of academic
        skills; applicability of prior experience to the position; understanding of tutoring methods; interpersonal
        skills; availability; writing ability (Writing Tutors); and English grammar proficiency (Writing
        Tutors).<br><br>
        Interviewers will gear their questions and discussion with the applicant to reflect these qualifications. Each
        interviewer may also record any comments related to a holistic evaluation of the applicant’s performance in each
        category.<br><br>
        Applicants’ hours of availability are also a consideration in the evaluation of an applicant for hire. The CTAS
        prefers to hire tutors whose availability reflects consecutive, rather than intermittent, hours/blocks of time.
        This helps to ensure that tutors are best able to keep a scheduled appointment with a student. In addition, the
        CTAS prefers to hire / rehire tutors who offer 15 or more hours per week.
    </p>

    <h2>Hiring Decisions</h2>
    <p>The interviewers’ comments and recommendations, along with the applicant’s writing sample (Writing Tutors), will
        be submitted to the CTAS Director. The Director will consider these recommendations, any/all sample indicators
        of the applicants’ mastery of subject content, and student need for tutoring in the subject(s) offered in order
        to make the final decision whether to invite the applicant to begin the certification process, hold the
        application on file for further review, or not continue with the application at this time.

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the Director’s decision is to invite the applicant to begin the certification process, the applicant will
            be contacted and invited to schedule time(s) to perform the certification/mentoring procedure;</li>
        <li>If the Director’s decision is to hold the application for further review due to budgetary constraints or
            staffing overload, the application will be held on file for one year and a letter will be sent to the
            applicant advising him/her of the status of the application;</li>
        <li>If the Director’s decision is not to continue with the application, a letter will be sent to the applicant
            informing him/her of the decision and thanking the applicant for his/her interest.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="line3_3">Tutor Duties</h2>
    <p>In addition to providing tutoring one-to-one and group tutoring both in-person and online, tutors are required to
        follow other procedures and guidelines outlined below.</p>

    <h2>Using MS TEAMS</h2>
    <p>The CTAS uses Microsoft Office 365 “TEAMS” as its main method of communication among staff on a day-to-day basis.
        TEAMS offers a variety of tools for CTAS staff to communicate and collaborate in order for the center to run
        smoothly. TEAMS consists of “members” who may belong to more than one specific TEAM. The CTAS uses two different
        TEAMS: one for full-time staff and one for part-time staff, such as tutors & administrative assistants. Within
        each TEAM, members can set up “channels” organized by categories. All tutors and staff are required to log in to
        TEAMS at the start of each shift and should monitor their TEAM’s channels and chats for messages throughout the
        day.</p>

    <h2>Checking in & out</h2>
    <p>All CTAS staff are required to use their respective “Check in-out” channel to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>check in at the start of their shift;</li>
        <li>check out for breaks;</li>
        <li>check back in after breaks;</li>
        <li>check out at the end of their shift</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All part-time staff should start a new “post” at the start of each shift to check in for the day and “reply” to
        that same post to check in and out for breaks and to check out for the day. That way, the Payroll Assistant and
        Associate Director can easily verify employees’ work hours for accurate timekeeping records. Any discrepancies
        between employee timesheets and check in / out times on TEAMS must be brought to the attention of the Associate
        Director before payroll can be approved. </p>

    <h2>Monitoring the General Channel</h2>
    <p>Within TEAMS, the “General” channel is where tutors and staff post messages meant for everyone to see. This is
        where tutors will find a list of weekly and one-time appointments for that day, Blackboard Collaborate links for
        tutors, and important messages from full-time staff.</p>

    <h2>Working with files</h2>
    <p>Each channel within a TEAM has a “Files” section, where any TEAM member can upload or view documents. Members can
        add folders and sub folders as needed. CTAS staff can go to the files section of a channel to find documents
        such as: staff schedules, commonly used handouts, or blank timesheets, to name a few.</p>

    <h2>Requirements for reappointment each semester (tutors)</h2>
    <p>The CTAS will employ tutors on a semester-by-semester basis to work with students, based on the following
        qualifications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Satisfactory TEF evaluations: Tutors’ TEF (Tutor Evaluation Form) evaluations from the previous semester
            must demonstrate that they possess, overall, “proficient” or “outstanding” ability to facilitate individual
            and group tutoring sessions according to CTAS philosophy and standards.</li>
        <li>Positive student satisfaction record. Tutors who have had numerous complaints lodged against them or have
            had multiple verbal or written warnings from the Director may not be considered for reappointment.</li>
        <li>Attendance record. Tutors must have consistently demonstrated good attendance and punctuality during the
            previous semester’s employment with the CTAS. “Good attendance and punctuality” means no more than 5 shifts
            or 15% excused absences or likenesses from tutoring during the previous semester of employment (absences or
            late nesses where notice was given to CTAS administration); and no more than one unexcused absence or
            lateness (absences or likenesses without any notice or call at least two hours before the start of a shift
            to the CTAS) during the previous semester of employment.</li>
        <li>Satisfactory attendance in Tutor Training. Tutors must have satisfied the CTAS in-service tutor training
            requirement in the previous semester, and must continue to attend at least 70% of the in-service tutor
            trainings in the current semester.</li>
        <li>Offering adequate hours of availability. Tutors must continue to offer adequate hours of availability, most
            of which during high-volume tutoring times throughout the semester. For instance, a candidate who offers
            large blocks of late morning/early afternoon hours would be preferred over one who offers only a few
            scattered evening or Saturday hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Administrative Staff</h2>
    <h2>Receptionist (Front Desk, Self-Study Area, Life Lab)</h2>
    <p>Administrative Assistants are extremely important to the center. They are often the first point of contact for
        students, QCC staff, and visitors to campus. In addition, they are responsible for accurate and timely data
        collection, which is used for departmental reports and quality control. Front desk staff also handle scheduling
        conflicts and may need to adjust tutors’ break times on given days.</p>
    <p>The CTAS is a busy place, and administrative staff may occasionally have to deal with frustrated students.
        However, unless it is a minor problem that can be remedied with a simple explanation or by making an appointment
        for a frustrated student, administrative staff should refer these students to senior staff members.</p>

    <h2>Administrative Assistant hiring process</h2>
    <p>Applicants should visit the “Employment” section of the CTAS website where they can fill out an online
        application and submit a resume for the Receptionist position. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Availability to work at least 15 hours per week (20 + hours preferred)</li>
        <li>Good listening and communications skills</li>
        <li>Ability to multitask effectively</li>
        <li>Basic computer skills (Microsoft Office)</li>
        <li>Previous customer service experience a plus</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="line3_4">Requirements for reappointment each semester</h2>
    <p>The CTAS will employ front desk staff on a semester-by-semester basis, based on the following qualifications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Satisfactory evaluations: Each semester, the Academic Resource Coordinator will formally evaluate all Front
            Desk Staff members. Evaluation forms from the previous semester must show overall, “proficient” or
            “outstanding” scores on all evaluation categories. In addition, front desk staff who have had numerous
            complaints lodged against them or have had multiple verbal or written warnings from the Director may not be
            considered for reappointment.</li>
        <li>Attendance record. Front desk staff must have consistently demonstrated good attendance and punctuality
            during the previous semester’s employment with the CTAS. “Good attendance and punctuality” means no more
            than 5 shifts or 15% excused absences or likenesses from tutoring during the previous semester of employment
            (absences or likenesses where notice was given to CTAS administration); and no more than one unexcused
            absence or lateness (absences or likenesses without any notice or call at least two hours before the start
            of a shift to the CTAS) during the previous semester of employment.</li>
        <li>Offering adequate hours of availability. Front desk staff must continue to offer adequate hours of
            availability, most of which during high-volume tutoring times throughout the semester. For instance, an
            employee who offers large blocks time would be preferred over one who offers only scattered hours. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Self-Study Area Receptionist (L-115)</h2>
    <p>Students are welcome to study in a quiet, clean area provided by CTAS. Self-study receptionists are responsible
        for welcoming students and checking students in / out using Starfish.</p>

        <li>Check students in & out using Starfish</li>
        <li>Help keep the self-study area neat (chairs, flyers at tables, etc.)</li>
        <li>Help set up the area for class visits and other special events</li>

        <li>Monitor MS TEAMS channels and chats</li>
        <li>Provide coverage in other CTAS areas as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Workplace Conduct (all staff)</h2>
    <h2>Workplace attire</h2>
    <p>While we do not have a "dress code," we do expect tutors and staff to dress appropriately for the position (i.e.
        avoid "dressing to distract"). Clothing which may be appropriate and fashionable outside the workplace, may
        detract from your credibility when you're acting in a professional capacity. Please keep in mind that your role
        in relationship to students is an advisor. We would like our students to feel that you take their concerns
        seriously and that you bring professionalism to the job. </p>

    <h2>These types of clothing are casual but still professional:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Jeans (not faded or ripped) or slacks</li>
        <li>Shirts with collars, such as Polo Shirts</li>
        <li>Button-down shirts or blouses (one or two buttons open)</li>
        <li>Dresses and Skirts which aren't too short</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The following clothing does not present a professional appearance:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tank tops; midriff tops; shirts with potentially offensive words, logos, pictures or slogans; halter-tops;
            sweatshirts or sweat pants, revealing tops and leggings.</li>
        <li>As always, personal hygiene and grooming is also essential when working in a professional environment. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cell Phone Policy</h2>
    <p>Many tutors use their cellphones when not in session, and that’s fine. But all phones should be kept on vibrate
        mode to reduce distractions to students and tutors who are working. Phone calls should be made outside the
        center, as to limit distraction.<br><br>
        Tutors who are in session should not use their cell phones at all, even if students are working alone for a few
        minutes. Students are reluctant to ask for help if they see their tutor using a cell phone, or a tablet or
        laptop, for that matter. In addition, tutors should not use their cell phones during a session to look up
        information for students. Rather, students should use CTAS laptops to do their own research, with the tutor
        merely acting as a guide.
